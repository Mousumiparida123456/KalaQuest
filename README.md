## Tech Stack
- Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, shadcn/ui-style components
- Firebase (Auth + Firestore)
- Genkit + Google GenAI

## Getting Started
1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```
2. Create `.env.local` and set your model key:
```bash
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_own_google_ai_key
```
3. Start dev server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

The app runs on `http://localhost:9002`.

## API Key Setup (Important)
- Use your own model key in `.env.local`: `GOOGLE_API_KEY` or `GEMINI_API_KEY`.
- Restart the server after changing the key.
- Do not use Firebase `apiKey` (from `src/firebase/config.ts`) for chatbot model calls.

## Chatbot UI
- Open `http://localhost:9002/chatbot`
- The page keeps one `conversationId` per `userId` in browser local storage.
- Signed-in users use Firebase UID automatically.
- Guests can set a custom `userId`.
- `New Conversation` creates a fresh thread ID for that user.

## Chatbot API (`/api/chatbot`)
The backend stores vector memories in Firestore and retrieves relevant memories by cosine similarity.

### `mode: "chat"`
- Required: `userId`, `message`
- Optional: `conversationId`, `topK`, `maxScan`, `historyLimit`, `remember`
- Returns: `answer`, `conversationId`, `relatedMemories`, `storedMemories`

Example:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:9002/api/chatbot \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "mode": "chat",
    "userId": "user-123",
    "conversationId": "conv-abc",
    "message": "Plan my weekend based on my preferences"
  }'
```

### `mode: "remember"`
- Required: `userId`, `remember` (`string` or `string[]`)

### `mode: "search"`
- Required: `userId`, `query` (or `message`)
- Optional: `topK`, `maxScan`

### Inline memory
If a chat message starts with `remember ...`, it is auto-stored as memory.

## Scripts
- `npm run dev`
- `npm run build`
- `npm run start`
- `npm run lint`
- `npm run typecheck`
